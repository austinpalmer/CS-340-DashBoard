# CS-340-DashBoard
Final Project from CS-340 Client-Server Development

# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

I write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable by using comments to desribe the function and by modularising these functions to make them reusable.
For example, the CRUD python file was used several times in multiple assignments the class underlined basic Create, Read, Update, and Destroy functionality. This not
only made it easier to understand what is happned in function/program but it makes less code to write.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

I approach a problem by first outlining the purpose and looking at how I can achieve this goal. I then break it down into requirments and smallers parts like functions and create a model
to view what is needed with that function. I am going to continue using this method as it proves effective at taking a big question and makes it easier to understand which in turn makes it easier to implement.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists analyze problems and how they can be solved or automated through the use of computer programs. My work gives companies like Grazioso Salvare tools to use
in their job which perform functions that may not normally be possible.
